# Rock vs Mine
## Introduction:
This project is designed to explore the differences between rocks and mines, helping users understand their characteristics, importance, and potential impact on the environment.
## Dependencies
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)
## Model
In our project, we employed logistic regression for binary classification, distinguishing between rocks and mines based on sample features. This straightforward model predicts the probability of a sample belonging to the "mine" class, offering a simple yet effective solution for geological classification tasks.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, our project demonstrates the effectiveness of logistic regression in classifying geological samples as rocks or mines based on their features. By leveraging this simple yet robust algorithm, we've provided a valuable tool for geologists, environmentalists, and mining professionals to streamline their analysis processes. With its straightforward approach and reliable performance, the logistic regression model offers a practical solution for automated classification tasks, contributing to informed decision-making and sustainable resource management in geological and environmental contexts.
